# StressFusion-RT

**StressFusion-RT** is a lightweight, real-time stress detection system that leverages webcam video to estimate physiological and behavioral signals such as heart rate via remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), blink frequency, and yawn rate. These features are combined to classify stress levels into baseline, mild stress, and high stress categories. The system includes a live, interactive dashboard built with Streamlit for visualization and monitoring.
